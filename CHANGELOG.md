## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Browser custom search engine** (`/search?q=...` + `/opensearch.xml`)
  - New `GET /search?q={query}` route redirects to `/?q={query}` so the homepage loads favicon results for the typed domain or service name. Intended URL for browser search-engine settings: `https://your-host/search?q=%s`.
  - New `GET /opensearch.xml` OpenSearch descriptor (linked from the homepage `<head>`) for one-click "Add search engine" in Firefox, Chrome and other OpenSearch-aware browsers.
  - The homepage reads `?q=` on load and auto-runs a lookup.
  - **Web UI — "Search from browser" modal**: step-by-step setup instructions per browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) with the search-engine URL shown prominently (click-to-copy and as clickable links per section). The URL is derived from `location.origin` at runtime.
  - **Web UI — "Tools" offcanvas**: the browser-search and bookmarklet actions moved out of the main page flow into a slide-in panel opened from a **Tools** button in the top navigation. Keeps the homepage uncluttered while both shortcuts remain one click away. Closes on backdrop click or Escape; opening the search modal closes the offcanvas first.
- **homarr-labs/dashboard-icons lookup** (`/di/{service}`)
  - New service-name lookup against the [homarr-labs/dashboard-icons](https://github.com/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons) catalog via `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons/png/...`.
  - Supports `?variant=color|light|dark` with the same `-light` / `-dark` suffix convention used for `/sh/`. Color variant uses the bare slug (`/di/jellyfin` → `png/jellyfin.png`); light/dark map to `png/{slug}-light.png` and `png/{slug}-dark.png`.
  - Service slug validation reused from `/sh/`: lowercase alphanumerics with `.`, `_`, `-`.
  - Returns HTTP 404 when the upstream icon does not exist (caches the negative result through the existing on-disk cache layer).
  - New `dashboardicons` cache provider key + `fetchDashboardIcons(service, variant)` exported from `src/providers.js`; `PROVIDERS.dashboardIcons(service, variant)` builds the upstream URL.
  - `/{domain}/json` now exposes the new source alongside `selfhst` under `endpoints.dashboardicons` (same shape: `service`, `proxy`, `source`, `variants.{color,light,dark}.{proxy,source}`). `null`-valued fields when the domain has no usable slug (i.e. no first label).
  - **Best-pick cascade** (`/{domain}`): `dashboardicons` is added to the candidate set when a domain has a derivable service slug, and is a valid value for `DEFAULT_PROVIDER`. `.env.example`, `README.md` and the Environment Variables table updated to list the new value.
  - **Web UI**: new "Dashboard Icons (homarr)" card rendered side-by-side with the selfh.st card under the same `data-card-type="service"` group and the same color/light/dark variant probe pipeline (variant buttons auto-hide when the upstream variant does not exist). The existing search-options checkbox now controls both service-icon lookups (relabelled to "Also include service icon lookups (selfh.st & Dashboard Icons)") and the meta description / Open Graph / Twitter Card / JSON-LD description / keywords in `<head>` mention both catalogs for SEO.
- **SEO: `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` and a templated homepage**
  - New `GET /robots.txt` route serves an allow-list: only the homepage and the three static assets (`/favicon.png`, `/logo.png`, `/sitemap.xml`) are indexable; everything else (the `/g/...`, `/g2/...`, `/d/...`, `/y/...`, `/f/...`, `/v/...`, `/p/...`, `/k/...`, `/l/...`, `/s/...`, `/sh/...`, `/s-asset`, `/providers`, `/{domain}` and `/{domain}/json` endpoints) is disallowed so search engines don't enumerate the unbounded favicon URL space. The `Sitemap:` directive is auto-built from `${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}`.
  - New `GET /sitemap.xml` route returns a single-URL sitemap pointing at the homepage, with `<loc>` derived from the request host (so it picks up the public origin behind any reverse proxy via the existing `trust proxy` setting; no env var required).
  - The homepage (`/` and `/index.html`) is now served by a small `renderIndex` route that loads `src/public/index.html` once at startup and substitutes `__BASE_URL__` tokens with the request's absolute origin before sending. This populates `<link rel="canonical">`, Open Graph (`og:url`, `og:image`), Twitter Card (`twitter:image`) and JSON-LD (`schema.org/WebApplication`) absolute URLs automatically, without baking the hostname into the image.
  - `express.static` is now mounted with `{ index: false }` so requests for `/` and the raw `/index.html` always go through the templated route — preventing the unrendered `__BASE_URL__` placeholders from ever leaking to the browser. All other static assets (`/favicon.png`, `/logo.png`) continue to be served by `express.static`.
- **SEO meta in `src/public/index.html` `<head>`**
  - Descriptive `<title>` (`MAFL+ Favicon API – Get high-resolution favicons for any domain`) and meta `description`, `keywords`, `author`, `robots`, `theme-color`, `color-scheme`, `application-name`.
  - `<link rel="canonical">`, `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` and `<link rel="sitemap">` for auto-discovery.
  - Full Open Graph card (`og:type`, `og:site_name`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:image` + `og:image:type/width/height/alt`, `og:locale`) for Facebook / LinkedIn / Discord / Slack unfurls.
  - Twitter Card (`summary` with `twitter:title/description/image/image:alt`).
  - JSON-LD structured data (`@type: WebApplication`, with `name`, `description`, `url`, `image`, `applicationCategory: DeveloperApplication`, free `Offer`, `author`, `isPartOf: MAFL+` and `sameAs` to the GitHub repos and the MAFL+ wiki).
  - Documented in `README.md` under a new "SEO" section and the API table rows for `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml`.
- **`CACHE_SIZE_MB` environment variable** caps the total size of the disk cache (`CACHE_DIR`) in megabytes. When the directory exceeds the configured limit, the oldest entries (by `mtime`) are evicted — both the data file and its `.meta` sibling — until the cache is back under the cap. Each cluster worker keeps a lightweight in-memory index of disk files and rescans the shared cache directory every 60 seconds (and on every set that pushes its local view over the limit) so writes from sibling workers converge into a single accurate view before eviction runs. Set to `0` (default in code) to disable the size cap and fall back to the original TTL-only behaviour. Bundled `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example` ship `CACHE_SIZE_MB=512` as a sensible upper bound for a typical deployment. Documented in `README.md`.
- **besticon integration for the HTML scraper**
  - New `BESTICON_URL` environment variable points at a sidecar [besticon](https://github.com/mat/besticon) instance (e.g. `http://besticon:8080`).
  - When set, `/s/{domain}` first asks besticon's `/allicons.json?url={domain}` for the icon list, then runs the candidates through the existing `sharp`-validated probe pipeline (`fetchBesticonCandidates` → `rankCandidates` → `probeScraperCandidates`). Falls back to the built-in HTML scraper (`fetchScraperPage` + `buildScraperCandidates`) when besticon is unreachable or returns no usable candidates.
  - The resulting entry keeps `provider: 'scraper'` so the `X-Favicon-Source` header, the scraper cache key (`?refresh=1` flow) and the `/{domain}/json` listing all stay backward-compatible.
  - **`/{domain}/json` now exposes the full discovered icon list** under `endpoints.scraper.icons` (each entry has `url`, `width`, `height`, `format`, `bytes`); empty array when `BESTICON_URL` is unset or besticon errors out.
  - **New asset proxy `/s-asset?url=...`** that fetches arbitrary upstream icon URLs server-side using the scraper's existing header retry strategy (bare → minimal → Sec-Fetch chrome headers). Cached on disk + LRU keyed by SHA-1 of the URL; SSRF-guarded against localhost / `127.`, `10.`, `192.168.`, `169.254.`, `::1`, link-local and ULA IPv6 ranges; max URL length 2048; only `http(s)`. Used by the UI so CDN Referer/hotlink protection on hosts like `redditstatic.com` or `redgifs` cannot break direct browser `<img>` loads.
  - **HTML Scraper card in the web UI** now renders a row of size-selector buttons (same `.size-btn` styling as Google/Faviconkit), populated from `endpoints.scraper.icons` and sorted descending by `width × height`. Clicking a size:
    - Idx 0 (largest) keeps loading via the canonical `/s/{domain}` proxy so click-to-copy on the image still yields the embeddable scraper URL.
    - Idx > 0 loads via `/s-asset?url=...`, with the meta row showing `{w}×{h}` and the upstream source URL plus a copy button (consistent with Google's behaviour).
    - Race-protected via a `currentScraperIdx` guard so a slow variant load cannot overwrite a newer selection.
  - **Bundled `docker-compose.yml` ships besticon as an internal-only service**: no `ports:` mapping (the besticon frontend at `/` is not publicly reachable), health-checked on `/up`, joined to a shared `besticon` bridge network so `maflplus-favicon-api` can resolve it on hostname `besticon`. `maflplus-favicon-api` declares `depends_on: besticon: { condition: service_healthy }` and is configured with `BESTICON_URL=http://besticon:8080` by default.
  - Documented in `README.md` and `.env.example`:
    - API table row for `/s-asset?url=...` covering the SSRF guard (localhost / private IPv4 ranges, link-local / ULA IPv6, `http(s)` only, max URL length 2048) and that the route is used by the UI for upstream icons whose CDN blocks direct browser `<img>` loads.
    - `/s/{domain}` row updated to mention besticon delegation via `/allicons.json?url=...` and the built-in scraper fallback.
    - `/{domain}/json` example documenting the new `endpoints.scraper.icons` array.
    - Docker section rewritten to show the actual two-service compose file (incl. the besticon sidecar with healthcheck, the shared `besticon` bridge network and `depends_on: { condition: service_healthy }`) plus a note on swapping `image:` for `build: .` and how to run the stack without besticon (built-in scraper fallback).
    - Environment Variables table entry for `BESTICON_URL`.
- **HTML scraper provider** (`/s/{domain}`)
  - Parses the target site's HTML for `<link rel="icon">`, `shortcut icon`, `apple-touch-icon`, `apple-touch-icon-precomposed`, and `fluid-icon`.
  - Reads the web app manifest (`<link rel="manifest">`) and merges its declared icons into the candidate list.
  - Honours `<base href>` and follows redirects to resolve relative URLs against the final document URL.
  - Adds standard fallbacks: `/apple-touch-icon.png`, `/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png`, `/android-chrome-512x512.png`.
  - Probes well-known larger size variants on CDN paths that follow an `NxN` naming pattern (e.g. `64x64.png` → `128x128.png`, `256x256.png`, `512x512.png`) to recover hi-res icons that SPAs only inject client-side.
  - Score-ranks candidates by declared `sizes` attribute and format (SVG > PNG > WebP > ICO), then verifies real image dimensions via `sharp` and picks the largest valid result.
  - Skips non-display icon types when ranking: Safari `mask-icon` / pinned-tab SVGs, and web-app-manifest icons with `purpose: monochrome` (or matching URL patterns).
  - New `cheerio` dependency for HTML parsing.
  - Scraper cache bypass: `/s/{domain}?refresh=1` (or `?nocache=1`) clears the cached entry and re-scrapes.
- **Google v2 provider** (`/g2/{size}/{domain}`)
  - Uses `t0.gstatic.com/faviconV2` for higher-resolution Google icons.
  - Supported sizes: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.
- **Faviconkit provider** (`/k/{size}/{domain}`)
  - Uses `ico.faviconkit.net`. Supported sizes: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.
- **logo.dev provider** (`/l/{domain}`)
  - Optional, gated by the new `LOGODEV_TOKEN` environment variable.
  - Returns HTTP 503 when the token is not configured.
- **selfhst icons lookup** (`/sh/{service}`)
  - Service-name lookup against the [selfhst icons](https://github.com/selfhst/icons) catalog via `cdn.jsdelivr.net`.
  - Supports `?variant=color|light|dark`.
  - Service slug validation: lowercase alphanumerics with `.`, `_`, `-`.
- **Provider configuration endpoint** (`/providers`)
  - Reports which optional providers are enabled (currently `logoDev`) and exposes the publishable logo.dev token to the UI for direct image references.
  - Reports `upstreamIpv4: true` when upstream fetches are forced over IPv4 (datacenter/VPS compatibility).
  - Reports `defaultProvider` when `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` is configured.
- **`/{domain}/json` endpoint expansion**
  - Now includes Google v2, Faviconkit (sized variants), Vemetric (default + sized + format variants), logo.dev, HTML scraper and selfhst entries (with `color`/`light`/`dark` variants).
  - Each endpoint exposes both a `proxy` URL (this server) and a `source` URL (upstream provider) for transparency.
- **Best-pick cascade** (`/{domain}`) updated to include the new providers
  - New default fallback order: scraper → Google v2 → DuckDuckGo → Google → Faviconkit → Favicon.so → Vemetric → Favicon-3j1 → Yandex.
  - When `LOGODEV_TOKEN` is set, logo.dev is inserted near the top of the cascade.
- **Web UI**
  - New cards for HTML Scraper, Faviconkit (with size buttons 16–256), logo.dev (only shown when the server reports it as configured) and selfhst icons (with color/light/dark variant buttons).
  - Search input now accepts both a domain (e.g. `example.com`) and a bare service name without a TLD (e.g. `radarr`, `sonarr`); when no dot is present the input is treated as a selfhst service name and only the selfhst card is shown.
  - "Also include selfhst icon lookup when searching a domain" toggle to additionally probe a derived service slug for any domain query.
  - Quick-link suggestions extended with self-hosted service examples (`firefox`, `immich`, `jellyfin`).
  - Front-end fetches `/providers` on load to conditionally show or hide the logo.dev card.
  - Favicon preview images append a cache-busting query parameter so browser cache does not show stale scraper results after redeploy.
  - HTML Scraper card shows the **proxy URL** (`/s/{domain}`) under the icon — the URL to use in apps — not the scraped site's homepage.
- **`upstreamFetch` module** (`src/upstreamFetch.js`)
  - Shared IPv4-only undici `fetch` wrapper with an optional HTTP/1.1 dispatcher (`allowH2: false`) for scraper retries against origins that reject HTTP/2 from datacenter IPs.
- **Cluster mode** (`src/cluster.js`)
  - New entrypoint that forks one worker per CPU core using Node's built-in `cluster` module; the Docker `CMD` now boots `src/cluster.js` instead of `src/index.js`.
  - Crashed workers are automatically respawned with a log line.
  - Configurable via the new `WORKERS` environment variable; defaults to `os.cpus().length`. Set `WORKERS=1` to run as a single process (clustering disabled). Note: in Docker, `os.cpus()` reports the host's core count rather than the container's CPU limit — set `WORKERS` explicitly when constraining CPU.
- **Performance / concurrency configuration**
  - New `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` (default `16` in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example`) raises Node's libuv thread pool above the built-in default of `4`, giving more headroom for parallel disk I/O (cache reads/writes) and DNS lookups under load.
  - New `PICK_HEAD_START_MS` (default `150` ms) controls the head-start given to the preferred provider in the new parallel `/{domain}` race (see "Changed" below).
  - New `SCRAPER_PROBE_BATCH_SIZE` (default `4`) controls how many HTML scraper icon candidates are probed in parallel per batch.
- **Configuration**
  - New `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` environment variable to set the preferred provider for `/{domain}` requests. Valid values: `scraper`, `google`, `googlev2`, `duckduckgo`, `yandex`, `faviconso`, `vemetric`, `favicondev`, `faviconkit`, `logodev`, `selfhst`. Other providers race in parallel after the head-start window. Logs a warning at startup when an invalid value is supplied.
  - New `LOGODEV_TOKEN` environment variable, documented in `README.md`, `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Documentation**
  - `README.md` rewritten to cover all new endpoints, the size matrix per provider, the selfhst lookup, the `/providers` endpoint, and the `LOGODEV_TOKEN` variable.
  - Endpoint table consolidated to use parameterised paths (e.g. `/g/{size}/{domain}`) instead of one row per size.
  - Documented scraper cache bypass: `/s/{domain}?refresh=1` (alias `?nocache=1`).
- **Response headers**
  - Favicon responses may include `X-Favicon-Url` with the upstream asset URL when known (e.g. after HTML scraper fetch).

### Changed

- `docker-compose.yml` supports local development via `build: .` (comment out for the published `ghcr.io/r0gger/maflplus-favicon-api:latest` image).
- Best-pick (`/{domain}`) now scrapes the source site first, falling back to network providers only when scraping does not yield a usable icon — typically improving icon quality and resilience for self-hosted/private domains.
- **Best-pick (`/{domain}`) races providers in parallel** instead of trying them strictly sequentially.
  - The preferred provider (first in priority order, typically `DEFAULT_PROVIDER`) is started immediately; the remaining providers start after `PICK_HEAD_START_MS` (default 150 ms) — or sooner if the preferred provider has already failed.
  - The first successful response wins via `Promise.any`. Cache-miss latency for `/{domain}` drops from "worst-case ~5–10 s across providers" to "roughly the fastest provider's response time".
  - `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` is still honoured under good network conditions thanks to the head-start, but a slow or failing favorite no longer blocks the response.
- **HTML scraper probes candidates in parallel** (`probeScraperCandidates` in `src/providers.js`).
  - Variant groups (sorted `NxN` CDN paths) are processed concurrently, while the sequential size-jump heuristic inside each group is preserved.
  - Loose candidates are probed in parallel batches (default 4 at a time, via `SCRAPER_PROBE_BATCH_SIZE`).
- **`MEMORY_CACHE_MAX` default raised from `500` to `2000`** entries per worker — higher in-memory cache hit ratio for deployments serving many distinct domains. Memory cost is per-worker (each cluster worker has its own LRU).
- Node process sets `dns.setDefaultResultOrder('ipv4first')` at startup; Docker image passes `--dns-result-order=ipv4first` for additional IPv4 preference on upstream DNS resolution.
- **`/{domain}/json` scraper `source` field** — reports the cached upstream asset URL when available, instead of always `https://{domain}/`.
- Static `index.html` is served with `Cache-Control: no-cache` so UI fixes apply immediately after redeploy without a hard browser refresh.

### Fixed

- **HTML Scraper size-button strip on production / datacenter hosts** — `/{domain}/json` now augments besticon's discoveries with the existing `STATIC_CDN_HINTS` + `expandSizedVariants` ladder before returning `endpoints.scraper.icons`, and `fetchScraper` does the same when picking the "best" icon for `/s/{domain}`. Previously, when the sidecar besticon was blocked by an origin's datacenter-IP filter (Reddit serves a JS-challenge interstitial to cloud IPs), besticon would only surface the 3 standard fallback URLs (`favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png`), so the UI's size-button strip rendered just `32 / 57 / 128` — even though our own node process could reach the CDN-hosted hi-res variants directly. The merged probe now lifts that to the full ladder (e.g. `64 / 76 / 120 / 128 / 152 / 180 / 192 / 256 / 384 / 512` for `reddit.com`, depending on which variants the CDN actually serves) regardless of whether besticon could see them. Implemented via new `deriveHintCandidates` + `fetchScraperAllIcons` helpers in `src/providers.js`; results are LRU-cached in-memory (configurable via `SCRAPER_ICONS_CACHE_TTL`, default 3600 s, and `SCRAPER_ICONS_CACHE_MAX`, default 500 domains) so the UI does not re-probe 8+ candidate URLs on every page load.
- **HTML scraper Reddit regression** — `<link rel="icon">`, `rel="shortcut"` (incl. combined `rel="icon shortcut"`) and `rel="fluid-icon"` are recognised again, alongside `apple-touch-icon` / `-precomposed`. `NxN` CDN paths are once again expanded to larger size variants (e.g. `64x64.png` → 128/152/180/192/256/384/512). Reddit's datacenter-IP interstitial only declares a single `rel="icon shortcut" sizes="64x64"`, so the previous tightening caused `/s/reddit.com` to fall back to the old low-res `apple-touch-icon.png` instead of the modern 192×192 chat-bubble logo. The `MAX_FAVICON_SIZE_JUMP = 2.5` guard still prevents Reddit's 512×512 marketing PNG from winning over the real 192×192 favicon. `STATIC_CDN_HINTS` for `reddit.com` / `www.reddit.com` is restored as a defensive fallback when the interstitial drops the icon link entirely.
- **HTML scraper on VPS/datacenter hosts** — upstream fetches now use a dedicated IPv4-only undici dispatcher (`src/upstreamFetch.js`), fixing broken IPv6 egress that caused CDN assets (e.g. `redditstatic.com`) to fail while same-origin fallbacks still worked.
- **HTML scraper icon probing** — CDN/cross-origin icon URLs are fetched with a bare `upstreamFetch` (no extra headers) before retrying with browser-like headers; extra headers were rejected by some CDNs from datacenter IPs.
- **HTML scraper homepage fetch** — retries across `https://{domain}/` and `https://www.{domain}/` with bare, HTTP/1.1, curl and Chrome user-agents when the initial HTML request fails or returns an empty body.
- **HTML scraper fallback ordering** — standard `/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png` fallbacks are only used when all HTML/CDN candidates fail, preventing a wrong 128×128 icon from winning over a reachable CDN hi-res variant.
- **HTML scraper static CDN hints** — when homepage HTML is blocked entirely (e.g. `reddit.com` from datacenter IPs), known CDN entry points are probed and expanded to larger `NxN` variants (`STATIC_CDN_HINTS` in `providers.js`).
- **HTML scraper variant probing** — when probing `NxN` CDN paths, stops before a sharp size jump (e.g. Reddit serves a full-body marketing PNG at 512×512 while 64–192 are the actual logo favicons).
- **HTML scraper mask-icon exclusion** — ignores Safari `rel="mask-icon"` / `safari-pinned-tab.svg` assets; these are monochrome pinned-tab silhouettes, not display favicons (e.g. `proton.me` showed a solid black "P" instead of the purple gradient logo).
- **HTML scraper manifest monochrome icons** — skips web-app-manifest icons with `purpose: monochrome` (and known monochrome URL patterns); sites like YouTube expose a white logo at 512×512 alongside the red favicon set.
- **HTML scraper manifest size threshold** — only manifest icons with a declared size of `512×512` or larger are considered, avoiding low-res manifest entries winning over a higher-quality `apple-touch-icon`.
- **Web UI HTML Scraper URL** — card no longer showed `https://{domain}/` under the icon; it now always displays and copies the proxy URL (`{origin}/s/{domain}`), matching how other providers expose usable API URLs.

### Internal

- New `fetchScraperAllIcons(domain)` exported from `src/providers.js` is the single source of truth for the merged scraper icon list (besticon + static CDN hints + sized variants, deduped + sorted by area). Backed by an in-memory `LRUCache` (`SCRAPER_ICONS_CACHE_MAX` / `SCRAPER_ICONS_CACHE_TTL`). Consumed by `/{domain}/json` (`endpoints.scraper.icons`); `fetchScraper` uses the same `deriveHintCandidates` helper to enrich its candidate pool before `probeScraperCandidates` so the chosen "best" icon matches the largest entry the UI displays. `probeScraperCandidates` is invoked with `limit=32` in the besticon path so the augmented pool is not truncated at the previous default of 16. The earlier `fetchBesticonAllIcons` export is now an internal implementation detail.
- `fetchScraperAsset` is exported from `src/providers.js`; the asset fetcher is reused by the `/s-asset` route.
- New `besticonIconsToCandidates` helper bridges besticon's raw `/allicons.json` response to the existing `{ href, sizes, type }` candidate format consumed by `rankCandidates` / `probeScraperCandidates`.
- `BESTICON_URL` is read once at module load (`process.env.BESTICON_URL`) and trailing slashes are stripped so both `http://besticon:8080` and `http://besticon:8080/` work.
- `services.txt` added to `.gitignore` (local notes file).
- `cache.del()` added for per-entry cache invalidation (used by `/s/{domain}?refresh=1`).
- HTML scraper upstream requests routed through `src/upstreamFetch.js` instead of global `fetch`.
- Disk cache metadata now persists the upstream `url` for scraper entries (used by `X-Favicon-Url` and `/{domain}/json`).
- New `runInBatches` helper in `src/providers.js` for bounded-parallel iteration with `Promise.allSettled` semantics.
- Disk cache directory (`/cache`) is shared across cluster workers; each worker keeps its own in-process LRU memory cache.
